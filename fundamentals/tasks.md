# Risk of Slashing

### What is at stake?

The stake used to claim the cohort SBT is at risk of being slashed and moved to the Raid Guild treasury.  This can only have after the [expiration time](../join-cohort/projects/expiration-timer.md) has passed.

### How to prevent slashing

**First**, you joined the cohort for a reason, so participate and contribute in order to learn all that Raid Guild has to offer.  Cohort specific team projects will be your starting point for participation.

**Second**, be brave.  Work with willing Raid Guild members to help them on projects they present.  Come up with new ideas for Raid Guild.  Offer your services and contribute proactively where you can.

**Finally**, your initiation as a Raid Guild member will require an existing member to invite you.  At this point, you will have the ability to reclaim you staked tokens.
