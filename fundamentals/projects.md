# Join a Cohort

### What is a Raid Guild cohort?

The cohort program allows groups of new initiates to participate in a series of onboard sessions, called a season.  Cohort members will learn what Raid Guild is all about, and how they can prepare for and envision participating on Raids and RIPs.

### What happens during the cohort season?

A combination of synchronous and asynchronous activity will occur for 3-4 weeks.  Each season may vary as we evolve and improve, but they typically include:

* Information sessions
* Cohort member introductions&#x20;
* Team building
* Raid formation
* Completion of a cohort team project
* Next steps



### How to join
