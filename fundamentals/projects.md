# Join a Cohort

### What is a Raid Guild cohort?

The cohort program allows groups of new initiates to participate in a series of onboard sessions called a season.  Cohort members will learn what Raid Guild entails, projects the guild is currently working on, and how they can prepare for and envision participating on raids.

### What happens during the cohort season?

A combination of synchronous and asynchronous activity will occur for 3-4 weeks.  Each season may vary as we evolve and improve, but they typically include:

* Information sessions
* Cohort member introductions&#x20;
* Team building
* Role Identification
* Cohort Raid formation
* Completion of a cohort team project
