# Stake to Initiate

As a new member joining a cohort you'll be required to add some skin in the game. &#x20;

### **Why?**

Cohort programs require an investment in time and resources to onboard new members.  In order to encourage serious participation and prevent waste, the dApp allows initiates to show they are serious about this endeavor through a staking process.  This will provide them access into the cohort program.

### What happens with the staked tokens?

The tokens are locked until one of two things happens:

1. **Slay** - The cohort initiate's contributions and participation results in them being chosen to become a Raid Guild member.  Their staked tokens can then be claimed back. &#x20;
2. **Be Slain** - The cohort initiate fails to continue their journey with Raid Guild.  After the designated time period (as indicated by the expiration timer), their stake will be able to be "slashed", claimed by the Raid Guild treasury. [Read more](../../fundamentals/tasks.md)

### Soul Bound Token (SBT)

Upon successfully staking the required tokens, the initiate will receive one SBT that can not be transferred.  This token validates that they have staked the required tokens in order to participate in the current or upcoming cohort season.

### How to Stake and Receive a SBT

1. Go to riteofmoloch.xyz {need to confirm address and link it}
2. Connect your wallet and confirm you are on the Gnosis network
3. Confirm what token and what amount is required for staking.  Aquire the amount needed.
4. Approve the staking amount transfer
5. Stake tokens.  A confirmation will show with your SBT related image and expiration timer.
