# Stake to Initiate

As a new member joining a cohort you'll be required to add some skin in the game. &#x20;

### **Why?**

DAOs invest time and resources into cohort programs with the hopes of onboarding new members.  In order to encourage serious participation and prevent waste, this dApp allows initiates to show they are serious about joining by token gating cohort access.&#x20;

### Soul Bound Token (SBT)

Upon successfully staking the required tokens, the initiate will receive one Soul Bound Token. This token validates that they have staked the required tokens in order to participate in the current or upcoming cohort season.&#x20;

### How to Stake and Receive a SBT

1. Go to [initiate-rite.xyz](http://initiate-rite.xyz)
2. Connect your wallet and confirm you are on the Gnosis blockchain
3. Confirm what asset is necessary for staking to join the cohort and what amount is required.
4. Approve the staking amount transfer
5. Stake tokens.  A confirmation will show with SBT token and expiration timer.
6. May the force be with you.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can bridge DAI to the Gnosis chain then swap to your token of choice using [honeyswap](https://honeyswap.org/).
