# Stake to Initiate

As a new member joining a cohort you'll be required to add some skin in the game. &#x20;

### **Why?**

Cohort programs require an investment in time and resources to onboard new members.  In order to encourage serious participation and prevent waste, the dApp allows initiates to show they are serious about this endeavor through a staking process.  This will provide them access into the cohort program.

### Soul Bound Token (SBT)

Upon successfully staking the required tokens, the initiate will receive one SBT that can not be transferred.  This token validates that they have staked the required tokens in order to participate in the current or upcoming cohort season.

### How to Stake and Receive a SBT

1. Go to [initiate-rite.xyz](http://initiate-rite.xyz)
2. Connect your wallet and confirm you are on the Gnosis blockchain
3. Confirm what token is needed to join the cohort and what amount is required for staking then
4. Approve the staking amount transfer
5. Stake tokens.  A confirmation will show with your SBT token and expiration timer.
6. May the force be with you.
