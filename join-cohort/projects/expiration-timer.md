# Expiration Timer

### Why is there a timer?

After you stake to be initiated into the cohort and receive your SBT, you will have a designated time to be initiated as a Raid Guild member.  The allotted time is indicated on-chain in the Rite Of Moloch contract and shown on the UI prior to staking.  The time remain is counting down.
